# Basic-C-Programs
Some basic programs written in C++

Whoops! The title should say "Basic C++ Programs." Oh, well. I think if you take a look at the code, you'll get the gist of it. 
These are simple boilerplate programs from one of those laminated quick study guides on C++ they sell at places like Fry's Electronics
and office supply stores. I'm not really great at any programming language, so I decided to sharpen my C++ skills.
